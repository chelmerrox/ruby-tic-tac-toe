# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

> In this project, we were required to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
This game is very simple:

- There is a board like the enumerated board above:

![board1](board1.png)

- Player1 is assigned to 'X' character
- Player2 is assigned to 'O' character
- Player1 and Player2 will turn plays
- Each play, the actual player can choose one of the 9 slots and fill with his/her character
- So, the board start to seems like this:

![board2](board2.png)

- Each slot can be selected only once
- The winner is the first player that 3 consecutive slots (aligned vertically, horizontally or diagonally), like the example above (where the player 'X' won due to the last horizontal line filled with 'X'):
