# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

> In this project, we were required to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
This game is very simple:

- There is a board like the enumerated board above:

   1 | 2 | 3
   4 | 5 | 6
   7 | 8 | 9

- Player1 is assigned to 'X' character
- Player2 is assigned to 'O' character
- Player1 and Player2 will turn plays
- Each play, the actual player can choose one of the 9 slots and fill with his/her character
- So, the board start to seems like this:

   X | X |  
     | O |  
     |   | X

- Each slot can be selected only once
- The winner is the first player that 3 consecutive slots (aligned vertically, horizontally or diagonally), like the example above (where the player 'X' won due to the first horizontal line filled with 'X'):

   X | X | X
     | O |  
     |   | X
